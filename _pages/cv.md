* M.S. in Computer Science, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2014
* B.Eng. in Software Engineering, Wuhan University, 2011

Research and Project Experience
======
* Research Assistant, University of California Los Angeles, Sept. 2014
  * Modeling co-evolution across multiple networks. Work published in SDM
    * Proposed a shared temporal matrix factorization framework to model co-evolution across multiple networks.
    * Demonstrated the benefits of this approach on the tasks including cross-network link prediction and community detection.
  * Link prediction with spatial and temporal consistency in dynamic networks. Work published in IJCAI
    * Proposed a link prediction model with spatial and temporal consistency, to predict links in a sequence of networks over time.
    * The proposed model characterized the network dynamics as a function of time, which integrates the spatial topology of network at each timestamp and the temporal network evolution. Advertiser competition analysis in search advertising. Work published in ICDM
  * Modeled the advertiser competition network, and explored the relationship between competition network and search providerâ€™s revenue
